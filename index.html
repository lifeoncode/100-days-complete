                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>
                        When I started <b>#100DaysOfCode</b> I wanted to focus on <b>JavaScript</b> as much as I could. I was already pretty good with <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>. About 34 days into the challenge I realised I didn't know advanced <b>CSS</b>😕 so I decided to tackle those concepts and started putting the knowledge into practice trying to cement it, which led me to learning <b>Sass.</b> In the beginning of this challenge I built <a href="https://my100.vercel.app" target="_blank">this website</a> to track my progress on a daily basis, so when I finished the challenge it only felt right to make another website showcasing what I learned, what I can do now etc...🙂 so yeah, thats kinda what this is.

                    <h3>Whats #100DaysOfCode</h3>
                    <p>
                        Its a coding challenge that has a massive community around it, the idea is to better your dev skills be it focusing on something specific or going wide. Not only beginners join the challenge, here you'll find developers of all levels which can be of great help in your own learning journey. There's a lot of reasons why one might wanna join the challenge but the most common one is to learn a certain concept you probably don't understand fully yet, among meeting and teaming up with awesome people on the interwebs😎
                    </p>

                <div class="answer answer_b">
                    <h3>How it works</h3>
                    <p>
                        So the basic definition goes something like this - code a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days and tweet your progress every day with the hashtag <b>#100DaysOfCode</b>. Reach out to at least 2 people on twitter who are also doing the challenge. By doing this you're actually publicly committing to learning code through practice every single day and letting the community know what you're learning each day. <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/" target="_blank">Learn more about the challenge here</a> or read <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4/" target="_blank">this article from freecodecamp</a>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="answer answer_c">
                    <h3>Then what?...</h3>
                    <p>
                        By the end of the challenge you'll probably be out of <a href="https://medium.com/@dannywakeling/tutorial-hell-74ad0d7bbf04" target="_blank">tutorial hell</a> and you may not know everything there is to know but you're far better than you were in the beginnig. What happens here is usually up to you, some developers find jobs after #100DaysOfCode, some continue learning, some go for round 2!.. I guess it depends on where you're at, how far you've gone in your dev journey.

                <p>
                    I would have loved to focus on JavaScript on my <b>#100DaysOfCode</b> but I ended up learning more of other tools like Git, Sass and more... even switched from <b>Windows</b> to <b>Linux</b>. <b>Server side development</b> looks attractive to me right now but what I want to do from here is what I had wanted from the first place. I'm gonna go for round 2 of <b>#100DaysOfCode</b> where I'll focus solely on <b>JavaScript</b>. I've already mastered the fundamentals and now I wanna go all in.
